# Application and Consensus Layer

The application layer in this platform built on the Ethereum blockchain with the help of a layer 2 network such as Polygon for scalability will be responsible for processing the different transactions and making decisions based on inputs from the Consumer layer. This layer will contain the logic that determines how the platform will operate in response to user actions and external events.

Smart Contracts will be deployed to define the application logic, implementing several pre-defined mechanisms to ensure the historical records have state transitions that comply and automatically change as users interact with it on the Consumer Layer. Itâ€™ll also be responsible for the rewards mechanism deployed using tokens to promote desired behavior.

These contracts are deployed to the blockchain and stored in a secure, immutable manner. The application layer is also responsible for interacting with other components of the Ethereum blockchain, such as the consensus layer and the data layer, in order to ensure that the application is functioning properly.
