# Consumer Layer
The consumer layer is responsible for displaying information to the user, such as the historical NFT audiovisual records stored on blockchain, as well as allowing the user to interact with the application by making transactions. The consumer layer will be created using JavaScript frameworks such as Next.js and be hosted using SWARM (distributed storage and content delivery protocol) which enables decentralized hosting of web applications based on Ethereum.

The application will include APIs for interoperability with existing traditional applications, which will enable the ingestion, curation, and consumption of historical records. This will allow institutions such as UNESCO, government entities, and archival organizations to utilize the platform's content to supplement their own efforts.
