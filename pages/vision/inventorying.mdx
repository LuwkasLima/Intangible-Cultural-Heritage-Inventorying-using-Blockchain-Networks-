# Inventorying Intangible Cultural Heritage

Decentralized blockchain networks can transform the way we perform inventorying and transmit intangible cultural heritage, by allowing distributed groups to record instances of intangible heritage practices around the world and submit them to the blockchain network, orchestrated by Smart Contract, in the form of non-fungible tokens, unique identifiable digital assets that can be owned by State Parties and other groups or institutions responsible for collecting intangible historical records. These tokens would contain relevant details of the practice for historical purpose and be registered in the network for posterior consumption. This in turn, allows for provenance of historical heritage records, which can be easily verified in the blockchain.

Additionally, protecting cultural heritage concerns can mitigate risk in each area of the ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) metrics, and contributing to such inventory, in the form of historical records or through investment, represents increase corporate transparency to shareholders, through verified transactions that reflect commitment to the society where these organizations are established.
