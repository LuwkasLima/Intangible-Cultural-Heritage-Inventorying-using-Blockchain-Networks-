# Transmitting Intangible Cultural Heritage

The preservation of intangible cultural heritage is also about the transferring of knowledge, skills and meaning from generation to generation and is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, that promotes respect for cultural diversity and human creativity.

Smart Contract blockchains like Ethereum also offer the opportunity to design reward mechanism to incentivize contribution of historical records to the platform, the curation process of these records and the consumption of these records for personal or institutional use as well as help orchestrate decentralized governance.

By designing a token on the platform that can be exchanged by consumers and contributors when interacting with these historical records, the blockchain platform can balance a healthy tension between supply and demand for historical archives of intangible cultural heritage and help ignite the process of transmission of knowledge, skills and meaning from generation to generation.
